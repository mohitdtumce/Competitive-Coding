# Chatting Application
Create a simple command-line application where a person can -
## Features
1. Create new user. 
    1. Inputs: Email, Name, UserName, Password. 
    2. Check if the username is already taken.
2. Login/Logout.
2. Follow/unfollow someone.
3. Send message (Personal, Broadcast).  
    1. Personal messages will directly go to the inbox of the person for whom the message is intended.
    2. Broadcast message will appear in the feed of your followers.
4. See my messages.
5. See my feed.

Note: No GUI Needed. Just Command-line application is fine.

## Taking it to the next level
1. Once user has seen a message, it should get deleted. 
2. Once user has seen a post, it should get removed from my feed. 
3. Add hobbies section and suggest friends based on matching hobbies. (Is this the only criteria? Can it be more versatile?)
